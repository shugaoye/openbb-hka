### Requirements

We are extending the existing OpenBB Workspace backend—a Python/FastAPI-based system currently without user authentication—by adding login and registration functionality. The proposed approach involves developing a separate frontend to handle user authentication, while the new backend services will be integrated directly into the current OpenBB Workspace backend.

**Frontend Requirements**

- Develop as a Progressive Web App (PWA) compatible with both desktop and mobile environments.

- Use React 18 with TypeScript and Vite as the build tool.

- Adopt a UI theme consistent with OpenBB Workspace (refer to existing Plotly and Tables components for visual reference).

- Utilize Radix UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling, including support for light/dark themes.

- Future enhancements will include features similar to OpenBB Workspace, such as chart and table displays.

Reference Components:

- Plotly Component: Uses React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Plotly.js with react-plotly.js, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. State is managed via React hooks.

- Tables Component: Uses React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, TanStack React Table, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and React DnD for drag-and-drop interactions. State is managed via React hooks.

**Backend Requirements**

- Built with Python/FastAPI.

- Use SQLite for initial development, with potential migration to PostgreSQL in the future.

- Implement authentication/authorization supporting:

  - WeChat Login

  - Username-password login

  - JWT token generation for authenticating with the OpenBB Workspace backend

- Provide a post-login page where users can view and copy the JWT token for use in OpenBB Workspace.

**Terminology Note**

- OpenBB Workspace: A financial data analysis and visualization platform; the name is used as officially designated.

- WeChat Mini Programs: Lightweight applications within the WeChat ecosystem, requiring no separate installation.

- JWT token: JSON Web Token, a compact method for secure authentication between parties.

- FastAPI: A high-performance Python web framework for building APIs; the name is retained as a technical identifier.
